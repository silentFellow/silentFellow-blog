&lt;p&gt;I recently watched Mr.Robot series.
At first, I simply thought it was a story about fancy technical stuff, taking down something corrupt or bigger than the protagonist. but as the series went on, it is more than that, a story about identity, how morallity plays in tough situation. a protagonist who wants to save the world. but in order to save the world, he has to save himself from his own mind. This blog is just my raw thoughts after finishing the show - nothing fancy, just how it made me feel.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why I Started Blogging</title><link>https://blogs.silentfellow.dev/why-i-started-blogging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 16:54:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blogs.silentfellow.dev/why-i-started-blogging/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I quote, Modern society, especially social media, pushes us to believe that in order to improve, we must constantly consume a lot of information(whether it&amp;rsquo;s needed or not). This makes us constantly consume things around us - passively. In this process we forget to take a deep breath, relax, and allow things to happen. This FOMO makes us restless, making us forget the existence of our inner voice, the concept of deep thinking. This thought hit me in the recent times when I realized I was scrolling endlessly without actually absorbing anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
