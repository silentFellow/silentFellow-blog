[{"content":"In this article , I discussed the reason behind starting this blog. Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through how I set up this website with Hugo — a static site generator. In the next parts, I\u0026rsquo;ll also talk about building your own custom theme, integrating tailwind css, adding search functionality, and showing similar post recommendations in a simple way.\nWhy Hugo When I started blogging, I wanted a simple, no-shenanigan, text-based blogging site with minimal js and a good SEO. While searching I came across Hugo — A simple static site generation tool that converts markdown into html for blogs. As a developer and the nature of markdown to be simple, I love markdown to take down notes. So when Hugo offers this flexibility I prefer Hugo.\nHugo is a high performant, SEO friendly static site generator tool from markdown.\nHugo Installation Helpfully Hugo docs are simple, and you can find Installation here Project Initialization And Folder Structure You can initiate a Hugo project with:\nhugo new site \u0026lt;folder_name\u0026gt; # if new folder hugo new site . # if in current folder After initialization, The folder structure will look like this\n. ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── i18n ├── layouts ├── static ├── themes └── hugo.toml NOTE: from here, you can simply use an existing themes(there are plenty available). But if you want to build your own simple theme follow the blog.\narchetypes/ contains a default.md file, which acts as a template for the metadata of any new content you create. +++ date = \u0026#39;{{ .Date }}\u0026#39; title = \u0026#39;{{ replace .File.ContentBaseName \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }}\u0026#39; draft = true +++ This is the default metadata Hugo adds for every new blog.\ndraft = true means the post only appears in development mode. Set it to false to make it visible in production.\nassets/ is used to store files that Hugo needs to process—like Tailwind CSS input, images that go through pipelines, minification, etc. We’ll use this to generate Tailwind output. content/ is where all your markdown blogs live. This is your main writing space. data/ stores optional structured data like json, toml, or yaml. Mostly used in portfolio or custom-data heavy sites. layouts/ is where you build your custom theme logic. static/ stores files that should be copied directly to the final site with no processing — images, JS, CSS, fonts, etc. themes/ contains downloaded themes. Each theme has its own replica of this folder structure. hugo.toml is the main config file for your entire site. Let\u0026rsquo;s Test hugo new \u0026lt;blog-title\u0026gt;.md # It\u0026#39;s best practice to use \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; in place of \u0026#34;\u0026lt;spaces\u0026gt;\u0026#34; This creates a file in content/\u0026lt;blog-title\u0026gt;.md, with the format of archetypes/default.md\nNow, for testing purpose let\u0026rsquo;s use a predefined theme. In this example, I use the terminal theme, since I like using terminal\nYou can find themes and their installation here for terminal theme After installing the theme, to use that theme:\nYou can either add theme = \u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt; to the config file Or while running with \u0026ldquo;- flag\u0026rdquo; hugo server -t \u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt; NOTE: some themes require a specific content folder structure, like content/post/\u0026lt;blog-name\u0026gt;.md for terminal theme\nRun the site using the following command\nhugo server -t \u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt; In the next part, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to create a custom theme by understanding the layout structure in Hugo.\n","description":"A simple breakdown of how I built my blog using Hugo — from installation to project initialization and understanding the core folder structure.","tags":["blogging","hugo","tutorial","static site"],"title":"How I Set Up My Blogs With Hugo — Hugo Project Setup","url":"https://blogs.silentfellow.dev/how-i-set-up-my-blogs-with-hugo-hugo-project-setup/"},{"content":"(No major spoilers - I’m keeping this experience-friendly.)\nI recently watched Mr.Robot series. At first, I simply thought it was a story about fancy technical stuff, taking down something corrupt or bigger than the protagonist. but as the series went on, it is more than that, a story about identity, how morallity plays in tough situation. a protagonist who wants to save the world. but in order to save the world, he has to save himself from his own mind. This blog is just my raw thoughts after finishing the show - nothing fancy, just how it made me feel.\nOne Liner The story follows Elliot Alderson - a cybersecurity engineer by day and a vigilante hacker by night. He joins a group called fsociety, whose goal is to hack E Corp and erase the world’s debt, thereby redistributing wealth.\nSeries Opening This is one of the best series opener I have seen, it starts with a monologue from the Elliot\nThere’s a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I’m talking about the guys no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top one percent of the top one percent. The guys that play God without permission.\nThis single line shows, how Elliot sees the world, who his targets are and so on. Then the scene shifts towards Elliot being his vigilante hacker thing, when he confronts Ron aka Rohit, a guy doing illegal stuff.\nThis scene make me like Elliot as a character more than anything, in this scene he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want anything fron Ron, Elliot is stoic in this scene, exactly like an Robot, just does things what he wants without any emotion or needs, he does not sway away with material things. Even when Ron tries to fake a sympathy with him about his personal life\nThis scene also showcases, Elliot\u0026rsquo;s technical stuff, which shows he\u0026rsquo;s a cut above any normie\nThat’s the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don’t give a shit about money.\nTechnical Masterclass One thing i love in Mr.Robot is how it treats hacking realistically. Nothing feels dumbed down. The attention to detail is insane - every hack feels grounded in how things work. And unlike many shows, Mr.Robot doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on magic shortcuts. The hardest part about any hack in the series and in the real life is setting up the right circumstances for the hack.\nPsychology in Mr.Robot The core part about the series is not just with its technology. It\u0026rsquo;s the psychology that makes this series special. Every hack is rooted in understanding the target\u0026rsquo;s mind - not just their machine.\nHack doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you simply hack computers. It also mean hacking the mind(Social Engineering).\nEvery main character has a layered, complex psyche - especially Elliot. His duality and persona all adds up a unique spice to the story.\nPsychology of the ending Even the ending ties together the core themes of the story. It\u0026rsquo;s not about having a gaint commercial ending where a group fighting and taking down a biggest evil. All the major evil is taken down before the final two episodes. The final two episodes focus on the minds and psychology of Elliot as a character\nAt first glance, Like all general audience I miss the big fight, a badass and goosebump movement at the end. But after a small while, I understand this is how a proper story to end. It brings a full closure at the end. A complete character development, along with the final emotional twist at the ending, that\u0026rsquo;s chief\u0026rsquo;s kiss.\nMr.Robot made me to understand, not all great stories should end with a big fight for a proper ending.\nThis clearly show me how much the creator pre-planned the ending\nOther things i like about Mr.Robot Music and OST: I enjoyed the music and ost in the series, especially the songs played in the background when no dialogue is needed, along with the thrilling sound tracks when in some series situations like a hack. Complex Psyche: The show focus on main characters with different psyche, working towards a similar goal for different reasons. It reflects the condition of real world, some works because they like, while some works for money, some for a delusional thought, while some for a higher purpose, while some works on obligation and so on. This shows reflects that perfectly. Flawed Characters: Flaws make any form of media relatable, \u0026ldquo;we humans, can\u0026rsquo;t associate ourself with perfection, because we are far away from it\u0026rdquo;. In this series, almost all characters are flawed to some extent, which adds a unique flavour to the story. Awesome dialogues: Some of the important thing, i like in any series is it\u0026rsquo;s dialogues, dialogues makes me feel the beauty of the situation and provide things to interperate in our mind. Breaking of fourth wall: When the concept of Breaking fourth wall is done correctly. it brings a new layer to the story. In Mr.Robot, Elliot constantly talks to the viewer as an imaginary friend, even the series opener about the top one percent of the top one percent are his monologue to the viewers. I am planning to compile all of my favourite dialogues and monologues of Mr.Robot, along with its context to the situation in another blog. Some things i don\u0026rsquo;t like about Mr.Robot Character development of some characters: some characters, a very few does not seem to have a proper ending, those character story simply exists and finishes for the sole purpose of Elliot character growth. Slow Burn: I don\u0026rsquo;t mind slow burn series, when the story is progressing somewhere, while Mr.Robot fulfils that, sometimes i feel like the setup takes too long, and sometimes it feels too slow. It is not a show to simply binge watch in a single day, you should watch a episode and let your mind interpret for some time. Conclusion Overall, Mr.Robot is a slow-burn psychological ride about identity, loneliness, and the battle inside our own mind. It heavily focuses on how people are prisoners of their own mind. If you enjoy character-driven stories with tech and philosophy sprinkled in, give it a try. The closure and the final twist in the series finale left me thinking and reshapes my perspective about a fitting ending.\n","description":"A spoiler-free reflection on Mr. Robot - a psychological and technical masterpiece about identity, hacking, and the battle inside the mind.","tags":["mr.robot","series","review","hacking","psychology"],"title":"So I Watched Mr.Robot","url":"https://blogs.silentfellow.dev/so-i-watched-mr-robot/"},{"content":" And I quote, Modern society, especially social media, pushes us to believe that in order to improve, we must constantly consume a lot of information(whether it\u0026rsquo;s needed or not). This makes us constantly consume things around us - passively. In this process we forget to take a deep breath, relax, and allow things to happen. This FOMO makes us restless, making us forget the existence of our inner voice, the concept of deep thinking. This thought hit me in the recent times when I realized I was scrolling endlessly without actually absorbing anything.\nI want to break out of this passive consumption and move towards active consumption, if I want something, I need to decide it and explore things around it - not the stuff these social algorithms want me to see. This is also my attempt to step out of my own comfort zone and actually listen to myself.\nWhy I believe blogging helps me to find my own voice? One of the most effective way to find your inner voice is to articulate your thoughts. Expressing an idea in any form allows you to wander in your own realm of mind. This helps you understand the thoughts you’ve been trying to express.\nExpression of thoughts in any form allows you to understand stuff in a deeper sense\nWhy I choose blogs as the medium of expression? There are several forms of content creation, I want a simple no shenanigans way of expressing my thought, and from that perspective i prefer a simple fully text focused blog site. The simple text format allows me to just express my thought without extra friction in my workflow\nConclusion Hopefully, you reading this will try to express your thoughts in any format. Just let that inner child, your own inner voice wander and listen to that voice.\nIn the world, where outside noise is high, always remember there is a voice waiting for you to listen inside you\n","description":"we talk to ourself in the process of thinking, the voice inside us that keeps to us company as we navigate our thoughts. but in the modern social media era, are we disregarding our own inner voice","tags":["blogging","social noise","social media","content creation","thoughts","problems"],"title":"Why I Started Blogging","url":"https://blogs.silentfellow.dev/why-i-started-blogging/"}]
