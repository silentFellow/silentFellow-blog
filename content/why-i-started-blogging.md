> And I quote, Modern society, especially social media, pushes us to believe that in order to improve, we must constantly consume a lot of information(whether it's needed or not). This makes us constantly consume things around us - passively. In this process we forget to take a deep breath, relax, and allow things to happen. This FOMO makes us restless, making us forget the existence of our inner voice, the concept of deep thinking. This thought hit me in the recent times when I realized I was scrolling endlessly without actually absorbing anything.

I want to break out of this `passive consumption` and move towards `active consumption`, if I want something, I need to decide it and explore things around it - not the stuff these social algorithms want me to see. This is also my attempt to step out of my own comfort zone and actually listen to myself.

### Why I believe blogging helps me to find my own voice?

One of the most effective way to find your inner voice is to articulate your thoughts. Expressing an idea in any form allows you to wander in your own realm of mind. This helps you understand the thoughts you’ve been trying to express.

> Expression of thoughts in any form allows you to understand stuff in a deeper sense

### Why I choose blogs as the medium of expression?

There are several forms of content creation, I want a simple `no shenanigans` way of expressing my thought, and from that perspective i prefer a simple `fully text focused` blog site. The simple text format allows me to just express my thought without extra friction in my workflow

### Conclusion

Hopefully, you reading this will try to express your thoughts in any format. Just let that inner child, your own inner voice wander and listen to that voice.

> In the world, where outside noise is high, always remember there is a voice waiting for you to listen inside you
